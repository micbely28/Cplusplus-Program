# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This is a program where a user can enter values for hours, minutes, and seconds. It will display two clocks. One of the current time and then one of 24 hour time. 
The user can then add an hour, minute or second, and the clocks would update accordingly

What did you do particularly well?
In this program, I was able code input validation quite well. I had experience in other coding languages and input validation was something that I had always emphasized

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think I could enhance the overall code by using other branching techniques, such as case/switches. In addition, I think some of my functions could have been shortened by writing more inline and efficient code.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
This was my first C++ program. I found some challenges getting into the habit of C++ syntax. When I began I was used to python syntax and style. It took some getting used to. 
In addition, another one of the challenging tasks, was converting everything to a string. Looking back it makes sense, but at the time I was thinking in terms of python, and I made a few failed attempts of not covnerting all the outputs to string.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think this project really helped to solidify a foundation in C++ and helped to give me more confidence in coding in various languages. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I was able to do this by separating the files and creating calls in the header files.
